# Wash.IT - Laundry Management System

Modern, multi-channel laundry platform bridging shop discovery, smart bookings, and digital receipts for Wash.IT partner shops.

## What's new (v2.4.0)

- **Dashboard Foundation** – Initial architecture for the partner dashboard, including secure routing, component placeholders, and data models for future features like analytics, booking management, and service configuration.

## What's new (v2.3.0)

- **Shop-to-booking hand-off** – Homepage map and cards now persist the chosen shop via session storage and URL params so the booking form auto-loads shop details, badges, and map markers.
- **Barangay intelligence** – GeoJSON boundary overlays, barangay filters, and highlight tooling for both homepage discovery and booking pickup maps (requires running through a local server to load the data).
- **Smart customer helpers** – Silent auto-fill with localStorage, per-field persistence, and inline email domain suggestions to reduce manual typing.
- **Self-claim scheduling flow** – Pickup + self-claim now exposes its own calendar/time-slot flow with validation, visual indicators, and messaging tailored to normal vs. rush bookings.
- **Time-slot & validation upgrades** – Philippine-time awareness, AM/PM grouping, rush-mode restrictions, 3-digit quantity validators, and refined error messaging across the 7-step form.
- **Location UX boost** – Leaflet-based pickup map picks a reliable tile stack (Google → Esri → Stadia), adds a custom “Use My Location” control, and gracefully manages geolocation fallbacks.
- **Receipt polish** – Customer and business receipt templates reorganized for easier customization.

## 🌟 Overview

Wash.IT supplies laundry operators and customers with:

- **Interactive homepage** featuring partner spotlight cards, map-based shop discovery, and seamless booking hand-offs.
- **Advanced booking workflow** covering service selection, schedule orchestration, customer profiling, payment choice, and receipt generation.
- **Responsive, modular design** optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile with feature-scoped CSS/JS bundles.
- **Location-aware experiences** leveraging Leaflet maps, barangay datasets, geolocation, and pickup/self-claim routing.
- **Productivity helpers** such as auto-fill, email suggestions, validation cues, and persistent form progress.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone or download** the repository.
2. **Run a local web server** (required for GeoJSON fetches and Leaflet tiles):

```powershell
# Option A: Python 3 (PowerShell)
python -m http.server 8000

# Option B: Node.js http-server
npx http-server . -p 8000
```

3. Open `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in your browser.

### Quick navigation

- **Homepage:** `index.html` – explore shops, open the modal, and click “Book Now” to jump into the booking flow with the selected shop context.
- **Direct booking access:** `features/booking-form/booking-form.html` – includes URL parameters like `?shopId=` for deep linking.
- **Receipts:** located under `features/booking-form/assets/receipts/{customer|business}/`.

## ✨ Feature Highlights

### Homepage experience

- **Shop discovery map** with barangay filter, session-persistent selection, and modal detail views.
- **Leaflet integration** showcasing partner locations with custom pins and optional barangay overlays.
- **Seamless booking hand-off** by storing the chosen shop in session storage and query parameters so the booking form auto-populates badges, titles, and map markers.
- **Responsive cards & modals** built with reusable CSS section bundles.

### Booking system

- **Structured 7-step flow** with service selection, schedule, items, customer info, payment, and confirmation.
- **Smart auto-fill** leveraging localStorage and per-field listeners to restore contact details silently.
- **Inline email suggestions** that surface domain completions and keyboard navigation.
- **Dual-calendar scheduling** for pickup/delivery and self-claim scenarios, tuned for normal vs. rush bookings.
- **Context-aware time slots** grouped by AM/PM, filtered by current Philippine time, and restricted in rush mode.
- **Advanced validation** spanning text, phone, email, quantity inputs, booking type toggles, and payment selections.
- **Pickup map enhancements** with multi-tier tile fallbacks, custom location button, barangay highlighting, and user pin placement.
- **Receipt generation** templates for customer and business stakeholders with dedicated asset folders.

## 📊 Data & Integrations

- **Leaflet.js** powers mapping across homepage and booking form.
- **Barangay GeoJSON** (`assets/data/baguio_barangays.geojson`) delivers boundary overlays—served via fetch, so a local server is required in development.
- **Local/session storage** persists customer details and shop choices between pages.
- **Geolocation API** drives “Use My Location” flows for accurate pickup pins.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Languages:** HTML5, CSS3, modern JavaScript (ES6+).
- **Architecture:** Feature-based modular directories for CSS, JS, and assets.
- **Styling:** CSS Grid, Flexbox, custom properties, responsive breakpoints (>1025px desktop, 769–1024px tablet, ≤768px mobile).
- **Performance:** Lazy module initialization, scoped bundles, optimized imagery, minimal external dependencies.

## 🧑‍� Development Guidelines

- Keep feature-specific assets within their module (e.g., booking map logic under `features/booking-form/assets/js/features/`).
- Use relative paths when referencing shared assets to maintain portability.
- Update homepage navigation and booking integration scripts when adding new sections or shops.
- For new scheduling logic, extend the helpers in `core/config.js`, `features/time-slots.js`, and `shared/utils/validation.js`.
